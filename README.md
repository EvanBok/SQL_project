# Which Movie Directors Are the Best Investment for Film Producers?
Using SQL, this project examines financial outcomes, historical trends, performance metrics, and audience ratings within the movie industry to generate actionable insights for evaluating directors as investment opportunities. It is broken down into two files:
1. **[industry_analysis.sql](Industry_Analysis.sql)**: This is broken down into give categories containing SQL queries that analyze director performance, historical trends, financial outcomes, return on investment (ROI), and comparative benchmarks.
2. **[insights.sql](Insights.sql))**:  Builds on the results of Industry_Analysis.sql by applying additional queries to derive actionable insights, which are summarized for a report to the Director of Analytics and Insights.

## Scenario
The producer company I work for is a large-cap, growth oriented film production company focused on choosing a director that fits a $300-400 million budget with high profitability, consistent results, and strong audience engagement.
