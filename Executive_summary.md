Given our $300-$400 million annual budget with a target of three films per year I have selected three directors who demontstrate:
* High profitability
* Consistent performance accross multiple films
* Strong audience credibility
* $60–100M per film, with a hard cap near $120M

**1. Christopher Nolan**

Nolan offers the strongest balance of profitability, consistency, audience trust, and budget compatibility, making him the most reliable long-term partner for our production scale.
* Fits the annual budget criteria with a $125625000 average budget per movie, which is within the $60-$120M per-film range for our annual budget.
* Combines high profitability with strong rating consistency accross 8 films.
  * Fifth highest total profit and eleventh highest average profit.
* High audience engagement and ratings
  * First in audience market and third highest average audience rating.


**2. Quentin Tarantino**
   
Tarantino is a good option when looking for projects that display a strong audience sentiment and target market, while remaining financially efficient.
* Falls well below the annual budget averaging $36900000, leaving room for at most 10 films.
* Strong fan base and ratings
  * Fourth highest average audience rating and audience market.
* Demonstrates strong audience sentiment and movie consistency with low variance in movie ratings at 1.0 and

**3. David Fincher**

Fincher offers steady performance, budget dicipline, and a strong audience which makes hime a strong investment choice.
* Fits the annual budget criteria with a $65000000 average per movie budget spent, leaving room for 6 total films throughout the year.
* Demonstrates strong audience ratings and has a large sample size of 10 films.
  * Fifth highest total audience engagement and top 20 in average audience rating. 

Using budget-constrained SQL analysis, I identified Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, and David Fincher as the strongest director investments for a large-cap film production company, balancing profitability, consistency, and audience engagement within a $300–400M annual slate.
